# Memory Game
This is the second project for the front-end development Nanodegree by Udacity.

# How the game works:
- You start by clicking two cards, the cards will be shown and their icons will be displayed.
- If the two cards are a match, they stay shown.
- Otherwise, if they're not a match, they will be hidden for you to try again!
- The moves will be counted, and that will effect your rating! (Less than 12 moves > 3 stars, less than 24 > 2 stars, and over 24 moves is 1 star).
- The time will be counted as well, so finish as fast as you could. You can do it!
- Once you match all the cards you will win. 
- But don't worry, you can restart the game at any point.

### The game can played on your desktop, ipad, and phone.
